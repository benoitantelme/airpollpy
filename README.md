# airpollpy
Project around air pollution in Python


The initial goal is to retrieve data (method to be decided) from the European Environment Agency and start cleaning the data sets and using them for visualization first. 
And potentially something more elaborate later that would require more data to start thinking about correlation and models.
Libraries used : pandas
