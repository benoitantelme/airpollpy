# airpollpy
Project around air pollution in Python

## What is it?
The initial goal of the project is to retrieve data (method to be decided) from the European Environment Agency.
Then start cleaning the data sets and using them for visualization. 
And potentially something more elaborate later that would require more data to start thinking about correlation and models.
