# airpollpy
Project around air pollution in Python

## What is it?
The goal of the project is to retrieve and analyze data from the European Environment Agency.
Initially inspired by this [article](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality-and-covid19/air-quality-and-covid19).


## Getting the data
I started retrieving the data for London using the [Bloomsbury monitoring station](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/networks/site-info?site_id=CLL2)
which code corresponds to GB0566A in the csv files.
A potential amelioration would be to take the data from all stations for this city and use a mean. However that is **a lot** of data.


## Stations
Comparison of all station data available from a 2013 data set to check the min, mean and max for a city in order to study 
and visualize those numbers before using the main data sets. Potentially it could be doable to select a **best** station 
for a city and pollutant instead of using the full data set.

Vizualisation of the worst, the best and a mean of all measures per cities and pollutant:

![European cities PM10 emissions in 2013](data/plot/stations/stations_plot_pm10.png)

![European cities PM2.5 emissions in 2013](data/plot/stations/stations_plot_pm25.png)

![European cities O3 emissions in 2013](data/plot/stations/stations_plot_o3.png)


Best, as in closest to the mean or unique station in a city per pollutant:
![Best stations NO2 for each city in 2013](data/plot/stations/best_stations_2013_no2.png)

![Best stations PM10 for each city in 2013](data/plot/stations/best_stations_2013_pm10.png)

![Best stations PM25 for each city in 2013](data/plot/stations/best_stations_2013_pm25.png)

![Best stations O3 for each city in 2013](data/plot/stations/best_stations_2013_o3.png)

## Creating a mean data set per city and pollutant
An issue with the **best station** method: some stations from 2013 don't provide data later. 
Also, a different station could be closer to the mean in later years.
I decided to use the whole data set available and work on it to build a mean for each city and timestamp.
The data in *data/main/cleaned* is available per pollutant, city and then a file per station and year.
The goal is going to be to merge every stations value and average it to a mean for the whhole city concerned.
